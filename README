Pigner: Stanford NER in pig

Pigner uses the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer: http://nlp.stanford.edu/ner/
to perform a basic classification (NER) on input text lines. It is an implementation
of a Pig user defined function for use in pig latin scripts. Pigner is provided as a 
proof of concept or demo to illustrate how third party java code can be used in pig.

Building:
An Ant build.xml is provided to create the pigner jar. Dependencies are provided 
with the source.

Running:
A demo application can be run by calling the pigernerdemo.sh script. This script
runs pigner on the supplied sample.txt in pig local mode. In order for it to run
$PIG_HOME should be set to wherever your pig-x.xx.x.jar resides. Please see the 
demo scripts for details.
